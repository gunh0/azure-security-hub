    "Description": "This document, CIS Microsoft Azure Foundations Benchmark, provides prescriptive guidance for establishing a secure baseline configuration for Microsoft Azure. The scope of this benchmark is to establish the foundation level of security for anyone adopting Microsoft Azure cloud services. The benchmark is, however, not an exhaustive list of all possible security configurations and architecture. The benchmark should be understood as a starting point. Site-specific tailoring will almost certainly be required.",

Your organization should review your policies and decide your needs.",

For example, when calling REST APIs to access storage accounts, the connection must use HTTPS. Any requests using HTTP will be rejected when 'secure transfer required' is enabled. When using the Azure files service, connection without encryption will fail, including scenarios using SMB 2.1, SMB 3.0 without encryption, and some flavors of the Linux SMB client. Because Azure storage doesn't support HTTPS for custom domain names, this option is not applied when using a custom domain name."
